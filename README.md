This repository contains data and spatial analysis of the 2024 Smokehouse Creek Wildfire in Texas.

The initial contents of the repository can be navigated as follows:
1. The project proposal can be viewed in the *Gaskill_Proposal.pdf* document.
2. Google Earth Engine code for raster generation of FCC, EVI, NBR, DNBR, Burned Severity, and Burned Binary can be found [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/b80f5e7fed31c15e0ee0efca2c5e241f)
3. The rubric can be viewed in the *Final_Project_Rubric.pdf* document.

## Description of raster (.TIF) files generated in Google Earth Engine
Landsat 9 Imagery was utilized. The original goal was to utilize Sentinel 2 imagery, but there were temporal inconsistencies.
1. FCC: False color composite, consisting of Short-Wave Infrared 2, Near Infrared, and Red bands of Landsat 9.
2. EVI: Enhanced Vegetation Index highlighting vegetation cover, using the following formula: EVI = 2.5 * ((NIR - RED) / (NIR + 6 * RED - 7.5 * BLUE  + 1))
3. NBR: Normalized Burn Ratio highlighting burned areas, using the following formula: NBR = (NIR -SWIR2) / (NIR + SWIR2)
4. DNBR: Difference Normalized Burn Ratio, an image differencing operation, using the following formula: dNBR = NBRprefire - NBRpostfire
5. Burned Severity: A classified burn map based on 5 classes: enhanced regrowth, unburned, low severity, moderate severity, and high severity.
6. Burned Binary: A binary classification map that shows burned vs unburned areas
